# Java and Spring Learning Application

In this repository I'll keep a application I used to re-learn Java and Spring, using Alura.
>Note that this project is focused on the REST API, so there's no Frontend, no graphic interface.
>>To circumvent the need for a full frontend-backend application to test the requisitions, this project will have a dedicated folder to Postman. That way, all requisitions can be propely tested. 
>
>Lastly, any comments on the application are study-direct. So whenever I feel like studying it again I can more easily understand certain aspects that are more complex and complicated
>>Due to this, the comments are in my mother tongue, Portuguese. So I can more easily and rapidly comprehend it

## Objectives

* Developing a REST API

## The Project Itself

This project will be about a ficticious medical clinic by the name of VollMed. They're on the need for a application to control the register of new medics, pacients and appointment schedules. Nothing that deep, but suficient enough to keep things under control.
