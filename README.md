# Java and Spring Learning Application

In this repository I'll keep a application I used to re-learn Java and Spring, using Alura.
>Note that this project is focused on the REST API, so there's no Frontend, no graphic interface.
>>To circumvent the need for a full frontend-backend application to test the requisitions, this project will have a dedicated folder to Postman. That way, all requisitions can be propely tested. 

## Objectives

* Developing a REST API
* CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Validations
* Pagination and Sorting

## Technologies

* Spring Boot 3.2.1
* Java 17
* Lombok
* PostgreSQL
* Flyway (Migration)
* JPA / Hibernate
* Maven
* Postman

## The Project Itself

This project will be about a ficticious medical clinic by the name of VollMed. They're on the need for a application to control the register of new medics, pacients and appointment schedules. Nothing that deep, but suficient enough to keep things under control.
